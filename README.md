# Poker Game Composer

### Overview
This repository contains a node application which is capable of managing the structural information for various poker games. This application is also useful to render the games in a 'card' which can visually describe how to play the game.

### Notice
This is prototype software. It provides only a basic user experience, contains potentially catastrophic bugs, and has missing functionality. Do not rely on it.
